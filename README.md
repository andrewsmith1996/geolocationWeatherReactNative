# geolocationWeatherReactNative
A simple app that uses Geolocation to get the weather forecast for a user's location.

A simple React Native app that uses the Geolocation functionality of a mobile phone and a WeatherAPI to retrieve a user's current location and return a 5 day weather forecast for that location.

I published a full guide on how to build this app as part of a "Let's Build" series of tutorials, found here https://dev.to/andrewsmith1996/how-to-build-an-geolocation-weather-forecast-app-in-react-native-in-30-minutes-1kmo

This guide was also a featured article in Tech Nottingham's October newsletter.
